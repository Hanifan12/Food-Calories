# Food-Calories

Bangkit Capstone Project 

An Application for detect food calories

Everyone has different calorie needs every day. It's hard to count the calories of each food without remembering and looking them up one by one. We want to make it easier just by taking a picture of their meal. So, we must find the most effective way of this method and the factor that will impact this calorie detection. We hope this project will bring convenience to Indonesian citizens, especially people who need a specific number of calories just like when they are on a diet.

This application will contains up to three task:
1. Login
2. Take photo of the food and scanning
3. Display food calories from scanning result

The greatest challenge in achieving good performance in this task seemed to be working with unbalanced and limited datasets, it needs a lot of pre-processing. Also high performance in food image detection with mobile phone camera is very difficult to achieve within one month period, which was a lesson learned during this project. And lastly, the current result canâ€™t be applied in many kinds of food, only varies at most 20 types of food

Suggestion for improvement mostly for the dataset, which we should make our own data that will be used for training and testing instead of using an existing one.
