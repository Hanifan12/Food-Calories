# Food-Calories

Bangkit Capstone Project 

An Application for detect food calories

Everyone has different calorie needs every day. It's hard to count the calories of each food without remembering and looking them up one by one. We want to make it easier just by taking a picture of their meal. So, we must find the most effective way of this method and the factor that will impact this calorie detection. We hope this project will bring convenience to Indonesian citizens, especially people who need a specific number of calories just like when they are on a diet.
